\fbox{Quads' Set-Up in SML}

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Yaw control
	
	\item Hover with integral action (altitude hold)
	
	\item Trajectory tracking: circle
	
	\item Automatic landing when QUALISYS fails (using landing from quad)
	
	\item Velocity estimation (is there a salt and pepper filter?)
	
	\item trajectory generation: leader following
	
	\item Problems with more than one quad: ROS code needs to be adapted (messages names need to be different for each quad)
	
	\item What can we log from quad
	
\end{itemize}
