\textit{``The stick input is a number between $-4500$ to $+4500$, to represent sort of $\pm 45^{\circ}$.  We take that number, and multiply it by Acro\_RP\_P, to get the the angular rate in centi-degrees.  Default RP\_P is $4.5$.  So $4500*4.5$ is $20200$, or $202$ deg/second. RP $10$ will give you $450$ deg/sec, this is what I flew in my video.  \\

Angular acceleration rate is the actual rate that the copter can accelerate in roll or pitch.  It can't jump from 0, to $450$ deg/sec instantaneously.  It could take $0.5$ seconds.  This would mean the angular acceleration rate is actually 900 deg/sec/sec.  This will be determined, physically, by the power of the motors, the weight of the frame, responsiveness of the ESC's, etc. We currently don't consider this at all, in the code.}''
